PHP DEVELOPER TEST

Create a CRUD in PHP using session variables to store and manipulate the data.

The main goal is to build a web app that allows, through a form, to add first name, last name, and
actual register date + time, then the users should be listed in a users list. This users list must allow
editing and deleting records. Youâ€™ll be using session variables instead of databases to play with the
information.

What you have to send as result is the base code of the app in a compressed file (.zip /.rar) or a
github link to the project.

The maximum deliver time is on 04/27/2022 at 12:00. Please, send the results to:
e.garcia@sell2rent.com. You can also ask questions to this email about the test.

IMPORTANT: Do not use PHP frameworks, use native PHP for this.
